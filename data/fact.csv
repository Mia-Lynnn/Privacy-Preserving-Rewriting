FC1,"Vanessa is a vinyl records store owner. She placed an advertisement on a social media platform selling a limited edition vinyl for the price of $500. On Monday, she receives a call from a customer, Niko, to reserve that vinyl. However, Niko told Vanessa that he is unable to make payment at the moment as he is facing financial difficulties, he then requested Vanessa to keep the vinyl for him for a few more days. Vanessa replied saying that ""Fine, I will reserve the vinyl for you until Wednesday 8pm. If I don?t hear from you by then, I will sell the vinyl for someone else.""

On Tuesday, another customer, Ken, called to purchase that vinyl. He offers $700 to purchase it, which Vanessa accepts. Vanessa then immediately calls Niko to inform him that the vinyl was sold to someone else, but his phone was unreachable at the time. Vanessa then sent Niko a text message saying that she sold the vinyl to someone else. It turns out Niko went out of town, and his phone was out of service. When he came back to collect the vinyl on Wednesday at 4pm, he was annoyed to find out that the vinyl was sold. Niko now threatens to sue for breach of contract.","['Vanessa placed an advertisement selling a limited edition vinyl for $500.', 'Niko called Vanessa on Monday to reserve the vinyl, requesting to keep it until Wednesday 8pm due to financial difficulties.', ""Vanessa agreed to reserve the vinyl until Wednesday 8pm, but warned that if she didn't hear from Niko by then, she would sell it to someone else."", 'On Tuesday, Ken called to purchase the vinyl and offered $700, which Vanessa accepted.', 'Vanessa immediately notified Niko about the sale over the phone, but his line was unreachable at the time.', 'Vanessa sent Niko a text message stating that the vinyl was sold to someone else.', 'Niko went out of town and his phone was out of service until Wednesday 4pm when he returned and found out the vinyl was sold.', 'Niko is now threatening to sue Vanessa for breach of contract.']",
